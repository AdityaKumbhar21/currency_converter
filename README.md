# Currency Converter App

This is a currency converter app which allows user to convert their currency to any other currency they want.

In this project we have used an public api for fetching all the currencies current values corresponding to the user's input  currency.

While devloping the project I learned about:
 - Custom Hooks
 - Resuseable Components
 - How to use custom hooks and reuseable components
 - API calls
