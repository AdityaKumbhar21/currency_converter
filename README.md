# Currency Converter App

This is a currency converter app which allows user to convert the currency to any other currency they want.

In this project we have used an public api for fetching all the currencies current values corresponding to the user currency.

While devloping the project I learned about:
 - Custom Hooks
 - Resuseable Components
 - How to use custom hooks and reuseable components
 - API calls
